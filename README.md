A partially implemented solution to the problem statement given by BMW.

Due to having a demanding Job at the JSE and personal responsibilities, it is not even close to complete;

ToDo:
The repository must still be created and added to the controllers using dependency injection. (SQLite)
The services that will start, monitor the batch. (was thinking of using Hangfire but not for a demo) need to be created.
will use async system.io to manage files.

A SignalR hub also still needs to be implemented to provide the status of the Job to all connected browsers.
I will eventually complete this solution, but just a couple of days is simply just not enough time.
